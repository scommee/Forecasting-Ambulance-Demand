# Forecasting Emergency Department Demand in Jakarta

## Overview
This project is a Time Series & Forecasting project coded in R. The main objective is to forecast future emergency department demand in Jakarta using telephony data. Throughout the project, various Time Series techniques will be employed to clean the data, format it appropriately, and compare these techniques with each other.

## Project Goals
- Forecast future emergency department demand in Jakarta using telephony data.
- Employ Time Series techniques for data cleaning, formatting, and analysis.
- Compare the performance of different Time Series forecasting methods.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Cleaning:** Cleaning and preprocessing of telephony data to ensure it is suitable for Time Series analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the characteristics of the dataset and identifying patterns or trends.
3. **Time Series Modeling:** Implementing various Time Series techniques such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, and Prophet.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the performance of each forecasting model using appropriate evaluation metrics.
5. **Comparison:** Comparing the accuracy and effectiveness of different Time Series techniques.
6. **Documentation:** Detailed documentation of the project including explanations of methodologies, findings, and recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- R programming language
- R libraries/packages for Time Series analysis (e.g., forecast, TSA)
- Data visualization libraries (e.g., ggplot2)
- Markdown for documentation

## Getting Started
To get started with the project:
